### Modified `src/pages/DatastoresPage.tsx`
- **Task**: Update /memory page title and add icon.
- **Changes**:
    - Renamed page title from "Datastores" to "Long Term Memory Storage".
    - Incorporated a `Brain` icon from `lucide-react` into the title.
    - Adjusted imports in `DatastoresPage.tsx` to include the `Brain` icon.
- **Reason**: User request to enhance clarity and visual appeal of the page previously titled "Datastores", now representing long-term memory storage.

### Modified `src/pages/DatastoresPage.tsx`
- **Task**: Update /memory page title.
- **Changes**:
    - Renamed page title from "Long Term Memory Storage" to "Memory (LTSM)".
- **Reason**: User request for a more concise title.

### Modified `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` (Attempt 1 - Erroneous)
- **Task**: Update icon for /tools route.
- **Changes (Reverted)**:
    - Attempted to replace `Wrench` icon with `Toolbox` icon (direct import) for the "/tools" navigation item.
- **Reason for Revert**: Caused import error as `Toolbox` is not a direct export from `lucide-react` in the current setup.

### Modified `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` (Correction)
- **Task**: Correct /tools route icon error.
- **Changes**:
    - Reverted the "/tools" navigation item icon in `Sidebar.tsx` back to `Wrench`.
- **Reason**: To fix runtime error caused by incorrect `Toolbox` import.

### Modified `src/pages/ToolboxesPage.tsx` (Icon Update Journey)
- **Task**: Update icon for "My Toolboxes" page title.
- **Initial Change**: Replaced `Server` icon with `Toolbox` icon from `@lucide/lab` using `Icon` component.
    - Resulted in error: `Failed to resolve import "@lucide/lab"`.
- **Troubleshooting 1**: Installed `@lucide/lab` via `npm install @lucide/lab`.
    - Resulted in error: `lucide-react does not provide an export named 'Icon'`.
- **Troubleshooting 2**: Attempted to use `createReactComponent` from `lucide-react` with `toolboxNodeData` from `@lucide/lab`.
    - Resulted in error: `lucide-react does not provide an export named 'createReactComponent'`.
- **Troubleshooting 3**: Updated `lucide-react` to latest via `npm install lucide-react@latest` and reverted to using `Icon` component.
    - Still resulted in errors, suggesting persistent version/compatibility issues with `@lucide/lab` or the `Icon` component for lab icons in this project's setup.
- **Final Solution**:
    - Replaced the attempted `Toolbox` icon (from `@lucide/lab`) with the standard `Package` icon from `lucide-react`.
    - Removed `@lucide/lab` import and ensured `Package` is imported directly from `lucide-react`.
- **Reason**: To provide a working icon for the page title after multiple attempts with `@lucide/lab` icons failed due to import/export or versioning issues.

### Modified `src/services/digitalocean_service/client.ts`
- **Task**: Align DigitalOcean API token retrieval with Supabase Edge Function secrets.
- **Changes**:
    - Refactored `getDOClient` to use `Deno.env.get("DO_API_TOKEN")` directly.
    - Removed previous logic for fetching token via a vault ID (`DO_API_TOKEN_VAULT_ID`) and Supabase RPC (`get_secret`).
    - Eliminated `supabaseAdmin` client initialization and the `getSecretFromVault` helper function from this file.
    - Removed `getDOClientSync`.
- **Reason**: To simplify token management by using Supabase's built-in secret handling for Edge Functions, per user direction, instead of relying on an external/custom vault mechanism for the DigitalOcean API token. 

## [2024-07-30]

### Modified `src/services/account_environment_service/manager.ts`
- **Task**: Change deprovisioning to delete toolbox records.
- **Changes**:
    - Updated the `deprovisionToolbox` method to physically delete the toolbox's record from the `account_tool_environments` table upon successful deprovisioning of the DigitalOcean droplet (or if the droplet is already gone).
    - Introduced a new private method `_deleteToolboxEnvironmentRecord(toolboxId)` to encapsulate the database deletion logic.
    - Removed the previous behavior of updating the record's status to 'deprovisioned' and nullifying its fields.
- **Reason**: To ensure that deprovisioned toolboxes are completely removed from the application's database, which will then cause them to disappear from the UI, providing a cleaner user experience.
- **Note**: The `toolboxes-user` Edge Function was redeployed to reflect these service-level changes. 

### Modified `src/services/digitalocean_service/droplets.ts`
- **Task**: Fix DigitalOcean droplet creation response parsing.
- **Changes**:
    - Adjusted `createDigitalOceanDroplet` to correctly parse the response from the `dots-wrapper` when creating droplets.
    - The code now looks for the droplet information within `response.data.droplets[0]` instead of the previous `response.droplets[0]`.
- **Reason**: The `dots-wrapper` returns an Axios-like response object where the actual DigitalOcean API payload is nested under a `data` key. The previous parsing logic caused a `DigitalOceanServiceError` (unexpected API response format) leading to a 500 error in the `toolboxes-user` Edge Function during provisioning.
- **Note**: The `toolboxes-user` Edge Function was redeployed to incorporate this fix.
